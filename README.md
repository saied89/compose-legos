### How it works
- Android frameworks/support repositpry is added as a git submodule and various Samples directories are added as source directories to a project module.
- Samples are processed using [ksp](https://github.com/google/ksp) and runnable sample code is generated using [kotlinpoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet).
- Generated samples are presented in the application.

### Todo
- [x] Add a way to inspect running sample state
- [ ] Add runtime theme modification support
- [ ] Add Analytics
- [ ] Add a way to change samples
- [ ] Add UI tests
